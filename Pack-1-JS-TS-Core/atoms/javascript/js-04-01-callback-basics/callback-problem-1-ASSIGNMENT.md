# 📘 ASSIGNMENT — callback-problem-1 (Tree Traversal)

## 🎯 Goal
Use callbacks to perform recursive traversal and search through hierarchical data structures.

---

### 1️⃣ traverseTree
Walk through every node in the tree and invoke `callback(node.value)`.

---

### 2️⃣ findInTree
Return the first node that satisfies a given predicate.

---

### 3️⃣ countNodes
Count all nodes that satisfy a certain condition (predicate returns true).

---

## 🧪 Run test
```bash
node --test test/callback-problem-1.test.js
```
