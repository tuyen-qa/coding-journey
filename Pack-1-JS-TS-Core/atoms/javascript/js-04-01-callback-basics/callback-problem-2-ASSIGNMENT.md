# 📘 ASSIGNMENT — callback-problem-2 (Async Simulation)

## 🎯 Goal
Simulate asynchronous tasks and understand how callbacks manage retry, sequencing, and flow control.

---

### 1️⃣ simulateAPI
Simulate an asynchronous API call with a given success rate.

---

### 2️⃣ retry
Automatically retry a failing callback function until success or max attempts reached.

---

### 3️⃣ queue
Execute multiple async tasks in sequence using callbacks.

---

## 🧪 Run test
```bash
node --test test/callback-problem-2.test.js
```
